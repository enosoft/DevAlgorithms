<b>Binary search</b></br>

Binary search is the search technique that works efficiently on sorted lists. Hence, to search an element into some list using the binary search technique, we must ensure that the list is sorted.
</br></br>
Binary search follows the divide and conquer approach in which the list is divided into two halves, and the item is compared with the middle element of the list. If the match is found then, the location of the middle element is returned. Otherwise, we search into either of the halves depending upon the result produced through the match.

<b>What is Iteration Algorithm?</b></br>
In the case of Iterative algorithms, a certain set of statements are repeated a certain number of time.An Iterative algorithm will use looping statements such as for loop, while loop or do-while loop to repeat the same steps number of time.

<b>What is Recursive Algorithm?</b></br>
Recursive algorithm, a function calls itself again and again till the base condition(stopping condition) is satisfied.
