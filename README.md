10 Algorithms Every Developer Should Learn

1. Binary Search
2. Selection, Bubble, and Insertion Sort
3. Quicksort and Mergesort
4. Huffman Coding
5. Breadth First Search
6. Depth First Search
7. Gradient Descent
8. Dijkstra’s Algorithm
9. Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
10. Doing Practice Problems
These first nine algorithms all gave you ways to solve archetypes of problems you might encounter as a developer. The reality, however, is that as a developer you are often going to be encountering algorithmic problems that are completely new. That’s why more important than memorizing any algorithm, is developing the ability to solve problems algorithmically.
Luckily, there is no shortage of websites to practice. Some of our favorites are:

https://leetcode.com/
https://projecteuler.net/ (More mathematical)
https://www.hackerrank.com/

These are great environments to find difficult, yet fulfilling algorithmic problems and hone your skills..
